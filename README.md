## Hi! I'm Ciara 🦠

🦠 I'm a second year graduate student at Georgetown University studying Epidemiological Modeling and Science Policy in the Global Infectious Disease program at Georgetown University. 

💉I'm particularly interested in using mathematical modeling to quantify the effect of routine childhood vaccination and to measure the implications of interventions on antimicrobial resistance. 

🌍 I've spent the last year and a half acting as the project lead on the [Analysis and Mapping of Policies for Emerging Infectious Diseases](https://ampeid.org/) under co-PIs Dr. Rebecca Katz, Dr. Colin Carlson, and Dr. Ellie Graeden
